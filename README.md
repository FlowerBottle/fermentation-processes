# fermentation-processes
Simulation of different fermentation processes in bioreactors.

You can choose whether you want to simulate a batcg, fed-batch or continuous bioprocess.

This simulation uses Monod kinetics for growth and the equations are explained in the pdf file in case you're interested in some bioreactor technology and reaction engineering of bioprocesses. You can also add product or substrate inhibition and maintenance metabolism if you like:)
